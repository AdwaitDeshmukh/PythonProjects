## Project Overview
This Pomodoro Timer is a simple yet effective productivity tool built using Python's Tkinter library.
 It follows the Pomodoro technique, which alternates focused work sessions with short and long breaks
 to boost concentration and efficiency. The application is designed with a clean and minimal GUI,
 making it easy to use for students, developers, and professionals.

- 5-minute short breaks
- 20-minute long breaks
- Timer reset functionality
- Simple GUI with Start and Reset buttons
- **Pomodoro cycle:** After every 4 work sessions, a long break starts automati>

## How the Pomodoro Cycle Works
